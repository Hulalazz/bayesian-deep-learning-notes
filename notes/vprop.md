## [Vprop: Variational Inference using RMSprop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01038)

The natural gradient descent in natural parameter of the variational distribution is equivalent to the mirror descent in mean parameter of it. Due to this connection, mean field variational inference could have a RMSprop-typed two-step update which is computationally efficient.
