## [Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424)

The authors work in a Bayesian neural network framework, and propose a reparameterisation trick for the update of parameters in variational inference (i.e. 'variational approximation to the Bayesian posterior distribution on the weights' in the paper). Also the author provide a way to do the update by mini-batch (stochastic gradient descent like).
