## [Bayesian Compression for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08665)

The authors proposed to put a sparse prior over the neurons to induce sparsity in neural networks. The work is built upon Bayesian neural networks. Two different sparse priors are considered in this paper: **the hyperparameter free log-uniform prior** and **half-Cauchy prior**.
