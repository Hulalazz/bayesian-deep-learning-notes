# awesome-bayesian-deep-learning
One-phrase-summary for Bayesian deep learning papers.

## (1). Uncertainty in deep learning
Model uncertainty in deep learning via Bayesian modelling by variatial inference etc.

## (2). Probabilistic deep models
Use probabilistic model to imitate deep neural networks.

- Deep Exponential Families - [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2581.pdf)] [[Note](/notes/deep-expo-families.md)]

## (3). Probabilistic neural networks
Use probabilistic methods to do the inference in neural networks.

## Contribution
Any contribution is welcome. But notice that we need '*one phrase summary*' to give an overview guidance to the readers RATHER THAN a list of papers. And please add yourself into the contributor list!
